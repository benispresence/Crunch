# NiceMeta

**Open-source Business Intelligence platform** — a Metabase alternative with a
Cursor-style workspace and a built-in Anthropic-powered assistant.

```

- **Python engine** — SQL execution, chart rendering (Plotly et al.), and the
  sandboxed user-Python executor, exposed as a small FastAPI service.
- **Express/TypeScript backend** — auth, persistent state (SQLite), AI chat
  orchestration; proxies compute-heavy work to the engine.
- **Vue 3 / TypeScript frontend** — a Cursor-style workspace: SQL editor,
  visualization panel, results table, and assistant — every panel is
  resizable and collapsible.

## Quick start

Pick one of the two paths:

- [**Docker** — one command, no toolchain setup](#run-with-docker)
- [**Native** — full local dev loop with hot reload](#run-natively)

You'll need an **Anthropic API key** for the AI assistant. The rest of the
app works without one.

---

## Run with Docker

The simplest way to try NiceMeta. Requires
[Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (macOS / Windows) or a
recent Docker Engine + Compose plugin (Linux).

```bash
# From the repo root
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env
# edit docker/.env — at minimum set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml --env-file docker/.env up --build
```

Then open <http://localhost:8080>.

What's running:

| Service    | Container port | Host port    | Notes                                  |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `frontend` | 80             | **8080**     | nginx; serves the SPA, proxies `/api`  |
| `backend`  | 3691           | (internal)   | Express + Anthropic SSE                |
| `engine`   | 8765           | (internal)   | FastAPI                                |

Data is persisted in named volumes (`nicemeta-data`, `nicemeta-workspace`).
Bring it down with `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down`; add
`-v` to also wipe the volumes.

**First-run credentials.** The backend seeds a default admin on first start
and prints the email + temporary password to its container logs:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs backend | grep -A4 "Default admin"
```

Sign in, then change the password via the **Change password** form on the
login screen.

---

## Run natively

You'll run three processes side by side: the Python engine, the Express
backend, and the Vite dev server. All three support hot reload.

Prerequisites (every OS):

- **Python ≥ 3.11** ([python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **Node.js ≥ 20** ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) — LTS is fine)
- **git**
- An **Anthropic API key** (optional, needed only for the assistant)

OS-specific setup below.

### macOS

```bash
# One-time toolchain (Homebrew)
brew install python@3.11 node@20 git
# Make sure Xcode CLT is installed for the better-sqlite3 native build:
xcode-select --install || true

# Clone and enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/benispresence/NiceMeta.git
cd NiceMeta
```

Three terminals — one per service. From the repo root:

**Terminal 1 — Python engine (port 8765)**

```bash
cd python-engine
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt -e ../.
PYTHON_ENGINE_TOKEN=dev-engine-token python server.py
```

**Terminal 2 — Express backend (port 3691)**

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and paste your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
npm install
npm run dev
```

The first start prints a default admin email and temporary password to the
terminal — write it down.

**Terminal 3 — Vue frontend (port 5173)**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>.

### Linux (Debian / Ubuntu)

```bash
# One-time toolchain
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3-pip nodejs npm git build-essential libpq-dev
# Ubuntu 22.04 ships an older nodejs — for Node 20 use NodeSource:
#   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
#   sudo apt install -y nodejs

git clone https://github.com/benispresence/NiceMeta.git
cd NiceMeta
```

Then run the three terminals exactly as in the macOS section above.

**Note on `better-sqlite3`.** The backend uses a native binding that
compiles on first `npm install`. `build-essential` (gcc, make) covers
this on Debian/Ubuntu; on Fedora/RHEL install `gcc-c++ make` and the
Python 3 development headers.

### Windows

The recommended path on Windows is **WSL 2 + Ubuntu** — follow the Linux
instructions inside WSL. You'll get the same fast hot-reload loop with no
toolchain pain.

If you'd rather run natively on Windows:

1. **Install prerequisites**
   - [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) — tick *Add to
     PATH* in the installer.
   - [Node.js 20 LTS](https://nodejs.org/) — the installer offers to add the
     C++ build tools needed by native modules; **accept that option**, or
     install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
     manually (the *Desktop development with C++* workload).
   - [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
2. **Clone the repo**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/benispresence/NiceMeta.git
   cd NiceMeta
   ```
3. **Run the three services in three PowerShell windows** (commands below
   use `python` — on some systems it's `py -3.11`):

   **PowerShell 1 — Python engine**
   ```powershell
   cd python-engine
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   pip install -r requirements.txt -e ..\
   $env:PYTHON_ENGINE_TOKEN = "dev-engine-token"
   python server.py
   ```
   *If `Activate.ps1` is blocked*, run
   `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` once, in an
   elevated PowerShell.

   **PowerShell 2 — Express backend**
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   # Open .env in your editor and paste your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

   **PowerShell 3 — Vue frontend**
   ```powershell
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

Open <http://localhost:5173>.

---

## Environment

`backend/.env` (created from `backend/.env.example`):

```
PORT=3691
JWT_SECRET=change-me-in-production
PYTHON_ENGINE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8765
PYTHON_ENGINE_TOKEN=dev-engine-token
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-opus-4-7
DATABASE_FILE=./nicemeta.sqlite
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
```

When running with Docker, the equivalent values come from `docker/.env`
(see `docker/.env.example`). The backend reads them as container environment
variables — there's no need to mount `.env` files into the containers.

---

## Workspace UX

- **Three collapsible panes** stacked in the centre — SQL/Python editor on
  top, the big chart in the middle, results at the bottom. Each pane has a
  chevron on its header to focus on a single surface.
- **SQL ↔ Visualization Python tabs** in the top pane. Picking any standard
  chart type generates editable starter Python code that reproduces it; edit
  freely and save it as a custom Python visualization.
- **Sidebar** lists connections, saved queries, saved visualizations, and
  folders. **Chat** sits on the right.
- **Assistant** streams thinking + tool calls inline. When it proposes a SQL
  change, a confirmation bar appears at the bottom of the editor — no silent
  overwrites.

## Filters and variables

Crunch supports Metabase-compatible filter syntax in SQL and Python charts:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE 1 = 1
  [[ AND created_at >= {{since}} ]]
  [[ AND status   =  {{status}} ]]
```

- **`{{name}}`** — variable reference. Values flow through your driver as
  SQL bind parameters, so they can't be injected.
- **`[[ … {{name}} … ]]`** — optional clause. The bracketed chunk vanishes
  when `name` is left blank; supply a value and it's substituted as a bind.

Every `{{var}}` you type is auto-detected and shown in the **Variables**
strip above the editor, where you set its type (`text`, `number`, `date`,
`boolean`), a default, and whether it's required. Python charts get the
same values exposed as a `params` dict — handy for dynamic titles,
thresholds, etc.

On a dashboard, click **Edit layout → Edit filters** to add filter chips
to the top bar. The gear icon on each chart opens a small dialog that
maps each filter to a variable in that chart's underlying query. One
filter can drive many charts at once.

## Version history

Every save of a query or a dashboard creates a snapshot you can revert
to from the **History** button in the editor / dashboard header. The
timeline is monotonic — reverting stamps a new "revert" revision on
top instead of rewriting history, so an accidental revert is itself
undoable. Identical back-to-back saves are deduped so the timeline
isn't noisy.

If the workspace is git-initialized (Admin → Git), each snapshot also
runs `git add -A && git commit`, mirroring the same history to disk.
The commit SHA shows up next to the in-app revision so you can `git
diff` between two points or push the lot to a remote. When git isn't
initialized, snapshots still work and live entirely in SQLite.

## Agent on dashboards

The assistant can build and edit dashboards too, using the same
Accept/Reject proposal flow as queries:

- `propose_new_dashboard` — create a board with optional initial
  widgets + filters in one shot.
- `propose_add_widget` / `propose_remove_widget` — wire saved queries
  onto an existing board.
- `propose_dashboard_filter_change` — edit the filter bar.
- `propose_widget_mapping` — connect filters to per-chart variables.
- `propose_navigate` — jump the user between workspace and a specific
  dashboard, e.g. after creating a query and adding it to a board.

With auto-accept on in the chat panel, the assistant can chain
"create a query → add it to a dashboard → take me there" into a
single hands-off flow.

## Tools the assistant has

| Tool               | Purpose                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_connections` | Browse the user's saved connections                  |
| `execute_sql`      | Run a read-only query through the Python engine      |
| `render_chart`     | Render a chart spec from columnar data               |
| `run_python`       | Execute sandboxed Python (the existing CodeExecutor) |

Destructive SQL is rejected by the engine's validator before any adapter
sees it.

## Surfaces

- **Workspace** — connections sidebar, SQL/Python editor, results, chart,
  chat. `Save` on the chart panel persists a Visualization.
- **Dashboards** — 12-column grid; toggle **Edit layout** to drag/resize
  widgets that point at saved visualizations.
- **Admin** (role = `admin` only):
  - *Allowed packages* — install/uninstall pip packages on the engine, toggle
    enablement; defaults (pandas, numpy, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy,
    altair) can't be deleted.
  - *Users* — flip roles between `viewer`, `editor`, `admin`. The first
    registered user is auto-promoted to admin.
